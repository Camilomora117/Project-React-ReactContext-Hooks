# React Task List

We are going to develop an API in React that allows us to perform CRUD operations on a task list. With this API, we will be able to create new tasks, read and display the existing ones, update the tasks that are already created, and delete the tasks that we no longer need.

### Implementation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Deploy
